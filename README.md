## AR Plane Tracking and augmentation
* Developed an augmented reality application that can detect and track real-world planes and augment a pre-fab 3D model onto the surface of the plane using AR Foundation and Unity 3D.
* The AR application uses a camera or webcam to capture video footage of the real-world environment, and then analyze the footage to identify and track flat surfaces, such as floors or tabletops.
